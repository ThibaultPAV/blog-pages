      <description>ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Blog! My name is Thibault, and if you&amp;rsquo;re here, it&amp;rsquo;s likely because, like me, you&amp;rsquo;re passionate about data science and its countless possibilities. I&amp;rsquo;m currently in my final year of engineering school, specializing in applied mathematics and modeling, fields that fuel my curiosity and desire to understand the world around us.
Why This Blog? Over the years, computing and data science have become central to my life, and this blog was born out of that passion.</description>
