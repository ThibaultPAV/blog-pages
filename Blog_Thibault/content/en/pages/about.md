# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my blog!

My name is Thibault, and if you're here, it's probably because, like me, you're interested in **data science** and computer science. I'm currently in my final year of engineering school, specializing in **applied mathematics and modeling**â€”fields that fuel my curiosity and my desire to understand the world around us.

## Why this blog?

This blog is a space where I share my **personal projects** in data science and computer science. My goal is to create a place for learning and exchange, where I can share what I've learned while discovering new ideas with you. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, I hope my experiences will inspire you and provide you with insights for your own projects.

## My mission: learn and share

I firmly believe that the best way to learn is to **share**. Through my articles, I aim to show you my processes, my successes, and even my failures.

## Interested in collaborating?

If you're looking for a collaborator to develop solutions or to delve deeper into the topics discussed on this blog, I would be delighted to discuss new professional opportunities with you.
