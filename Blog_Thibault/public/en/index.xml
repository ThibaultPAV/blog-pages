      <description>üåç Imagine a world where machines learn to make decisions, adjusting their strategies over time to achieve specific goals. This world is no longer just a vision of the future, but a reality thanks to Reinforcement Learning (RL).
If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about how this technology works, you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place. In this article, I will explain in a simple and clear manner the essential concepts of RL, an artificial intelligence technique that allows machines to learn independently, without supervision.</description>

      <description>üëã Welcome to my blog! My name is Thibault, and if you&amp;rsquo;re here, it&amp;rsquo;s probably because, like me, you&amp;rsquo;re interested in data science and computer science. I&amp;rsquo;m currently in my final year of engineering school, specializing in applied mathematics and modeling‚Äîfields that fuel my curiosity and my desire to understand the world around us.
Why this blog? This blog is a space where I share my personal projects in data science and computer science.</description>
